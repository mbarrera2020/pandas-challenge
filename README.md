Description:  Python Panda script for analyzing school & student records.

## Background
There are 2 challenges:  HeroespfPyMoli & PyCitySchools.  
The Python Pandas code only addresses the PyCithySchools challenge.

## PyCitySchools
The PyCitySchools Python Panda script processes 2 csv files: students & schools.
 * uses data frames, calculations, average function & data formatting

Input: 
CSV files: students & schools

Process:
The PyCitySchools Python Panda script analyzes the school & student data and does the followwing calculations:

* District Summary
  Calculate the total number of schools
  Calculate the total number of students
  Calculate the total budget
  Calculate the average math score 
  Calculate the average reading score
  Calculate the percentage of students with a passing math score (70 or greater)
  Calculate the percentage of students with a passing reading score (70 or greater)
  Calculate the percentage of students who passed math and reading (% Overall Passing)
  Create a dataframe to hold the above results
  -- data formaatted 

* School Summary -- an overview table that summarizes key metrics about each school, including:
  School Name
  School Type
  Total Students
  Total School Budget
  Per Student Budget
  Average Math Score
  Average Reading Score
  % Passing Math
  % Passing Reading
  % Overall Passing (The percentage of students that passed math and reading.)
  -- creates a dataframe to hold the above results
  
  * other:
    - display the results on the terminal
    - report an analysis doc
